# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

### Getting started
First install lua and [luarocks][2] using [homebrew][1]

    $ brew install lua

Then install [busted][3] testing framework for lua

    $ luarocks install busted

Then run your test

    $ busted bob_test.lua
